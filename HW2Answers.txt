1.32 To add a new field to an object, the new field would have to be created in the editor of that object’s parent class. 
1.33 void send(String)1.34 int average(int x, int y)1.35 The textbook is an object of the class “Book.”1.36 Because an object is defined as a specific instance of a particular class, an object can belong to only one class. 

2.6 public class Student {}
    public class LabClass {}

2.11 The two features of the constructor that make it look different from the methods are that it is the only one which has the name of the class in the header and there is no word (such as int, void) between “public” and TicketMachine.

2.17 private int status;

2.21 name = petsName;

2.22 public Date(String month, int day, int year)

2.23 I see no difference between the getPrice and getBalance methods other than the words balance and price. This makes sense since they are both “get” methods.  

2.26 public int getTotal()

2.28 The main difference between the two headers is that on contains an int return type and the other contains a void return type.

2.29 Neither of the two has a return statement. This is probably related to them both having “void” return types. 

2.33 score = score + points;

2.35 price = price - amount;

2.37 public void prompt() {System.out.println(“Please insert the correct amount of money.”);}

2.41 public void showPrice() {System.out.println(“The price of a ticket is xyz cents.”) xyz = price;}
